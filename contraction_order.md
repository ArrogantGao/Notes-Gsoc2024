# Tensor Network Contraction Order

## Introduction

Tensor networks are a powerful tool for representing and manipulating high-dimensional data. The contraction of a tensor network is a fundamental operation in tensor network methods. The computational cost of the contraction depends on the order of the contraction, which is the order in which the tensors are multiplied. The optimal contraction order can significantly reduce the computational cost of the contraction.
